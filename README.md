## ðŸ’¡ Why I Built This

This was another mini project for me in Python to help get to grips with the syntax and what can be built with the language.
I want to expand it further in the future using some predictive logic to make the machine harder to beat as of now its moves are just randomised, but i still think its pretty cool :)
